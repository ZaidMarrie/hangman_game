This is a word guessing game known as hangman. It is still a work in progress, however as I continue my javascript learning journey I will gradually improve the game.

### What I learned

So far this game is only based on what I learned and I created it with only conditionals and loops. I learned how to:

- Use while loops
- Iterate through arrays using a while loop
- Use for loops
- Iterate through arrays using a for loop
- Use loops to check conditions of in an array



### Continued development

I am starting to learn about functions and I will gradually improve this project as I learn new concepts.
